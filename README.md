# Node-Command-Line-App
Overview
We now arrive at another important milestone in our journey. The JavaScript you wrote for your first project was executed entirely on the client side, though it used third-party server-side APIs. In this and later units, you will learn how to write your own server-side applications to handle requests and ultimately to build your own APIs.
In a previous era, this would be the point in our full-stack journey where we would begin learning a second programming language, such as PHP, to write server-side code. Luckily for us, Node.js—which was released in 2009—makes this unnecessary. Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine without Chrome, and allows us to write server-side code using JavaScript. We no longer need a browser to run JavaScript. We can (and will) do so from the command line.
In this unit, you will learn how to initialize a Node.js project, install third-party dependencies, and create interactive command-line applications. Node.js ships with what is referred to as a standard library. The standard library contains a number of modules that allow us to extend the functionality of Node.js, such as fs, which we will use to read and write files. There is also a large and robust ecosystem of third-party modules that you will learn how to add to applications to extend their functionality.

Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:


What is npm?


What are three of the major changes introduced to JavaScript in ES6?


What are three approaches to handling asynchronous JavaScript?



Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if are able to:


Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.


Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.


Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.


Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as let, const, and arrow functions.


Handle asynchrony with callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

Make server-side API calls with the Fetch API and Axios.
